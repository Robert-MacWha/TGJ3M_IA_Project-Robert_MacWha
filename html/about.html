            <p class="pt-2">Shawn was born in the small town of Lachute, Quebec about 50 kilometers west of Montreal. He grew up in the forests and lakes of the Laurentian Mountains where he developed a deep love of nature that informs his writing to this day. His stories speak of the everyday challenges faced by people across the country and of the healing power of the Canadian landscape. They look for hidden glimpses of the marvelous in everyday things and show us that through the call of a loon or the chatter of a squirrel we can reconnect with our roots and find the peace which each of us deserves. A former academic, Shawn holds a Master of Arts degree in Military and Strategic Studies from the University of Calgary and still writes non-fiction when the mood strikes him.</p>

            <p>An adventurous traveler Shawn has visited over fifty countries in every continent except for Antarctica. He spent five years living in Asia and still longs for the soft, diffuse light of the sun rising over the Pacific Ocean. In Canada, he has been to every province and territory except for the Yukon and Nunavut and has walked endless trails from the eastern shores of Newfoundland to the sun-wrapped prairies and the towering mountains of the west. Based in Ottawa, he spends as much time as possible in the pine forests of Algonquin Park with his amazing wife and his four lovely children. In March of 2020 he completed his first novel, Eastern Horizons (located on Amazon.ca), which explores the limits of individual and collective compassion, and our capacity for self-forgiveness when we fail what Abraham Lincoln once called “the better angels of our nature.”</p>
