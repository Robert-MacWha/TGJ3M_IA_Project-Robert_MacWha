    <p>On a quiet night local residents can still hear the VIA trains running to and from Montreal down along Russel Road but its been almost 70 years since anyone could actually catch a train anywhere near Blackburn Hamlet. Fortunately, the on-going construction of the Montreal Road LRT station on highway 174 heralds the return of rail transportation to the area. Once the Confederation Line East Extension is complete in 2024 it will be possible for residents of the Hamlet to walk, bike or take a short bus ride to the new station. From there they will be able to take a train heading east to Trim Road and the beach at Petrie Island or west into the city and places such as the Byward Market, the University of Ottawa, Carleton University, Algonquin College and the airport. By then OC Transpo’s light rail network will consist of almost 65 km tracks and 41 stops stretching across the city.</p>

    <p>As exciting as this is it is by no means the first time that trains have run past our little community. Trains first came to Blackburn in the fall of 1898 when the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR) opened its line from Ottawa to Montreal south of Renaud Road. This route carried passengers between the two cities until VIA cancelled its transcontinental service at the end of 1981. Following the decommissioning of that line the tracks were pulled up in 1989 and, later, the railbed was converted to the Prescott-Russel Trail Link. This multi-use pathway now runs from just east of the city garage at the end of Cyrville Road all of the way to the Quebec border. Eagle-eyed walkers along this path can still find treasures such as lumps of coal, piles of steel slag once used as track ballast and even the odd railway spike.</p>

    <p>During much of that line’s 83 years of operation local residents could catch a train into Ottawa from Blackburn Station, which stood at the southwest corner of Anderson Road and the current rail-trail. This station, which was likely built when the line was first opened stood until it burned down on Christmas Eve, 1953. An excellent account of that building’s existence, and demise, can be found in the June 2019 issue of BANAR (Blackburn Station, Banar. Vol. 52, No 5., June 2019, p. 18).</p>

    <p>North of Blackburn, and closer to where the new O-train will run, lies another abandoned railbed. From 1909 until 1939 the Canadian Northern Railway (CnoR) followed the south shore of the Ottawa River from Sandy Hill all of the way to Hawkesbury where it crossed into Quebec and met up with the Carillon and Grenville Railway. Unlike the old CPR line this right of way has not been maintained and for the most part the path of the old steam trains is hard to follow save for a short walk behind the parking lot at the Green’s Creek toboggan hill. Those who do follow this trail will reach a lookout where they can see the old concrete footings of the railway’s trestle bridge over Green’s Creek. There are also many signs of this old thoroughfare visible from highway 174 including a beautiful stone culvert over Cardinal Creek just past Trim Road, several rock cuts heading out towards Cumberland and, further east, the bridge pilings where the line crossed the South Nation River at Jessups Falls. While sometimes not obvious from the ground, much of the old right of way can still be discerned using Google Earth.</p>

    <p>While the new O-train has obviously had its teething pains one can hope that they’ll be all settled by the time that the Stage 2 extensions are complete. Once that happens we will once again be able to take a train downtown or, with a simple stop at the Ottawa train station and a little bit of courage, all of the way out to Halifax or Vancouver.</p>
