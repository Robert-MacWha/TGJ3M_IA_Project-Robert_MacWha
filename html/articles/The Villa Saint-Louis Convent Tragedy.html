    <p>May 15th will mark the 64th anniversary of one of the greatest, and least known. tragedies to ever befall the area around our community. At 10:37 pm on that night in 1956 a CF-100 Canuck interceptor from  Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Station Uplands, tail number 18367, crashed into the Villa Saint-Louis Convent in Orleans. Falling from a height of over 10,000 metres the plane hit the convent’s main chapel almost vertically at almost 1100 kph and tore through the building, setting it alight with burning kerosene jet fuel and exploding “Mighty Mouse” rockets. Inside the three-story brick facility, which sat alone beside the Ottawa River surrounded by hundreds of acres of fields and forest, were 38 people, many of whom had already retired for the evening. In the resulting inferno both pilots, 11 Sisters of the Grey Nuns of the Cross (hence Grey Nuns Drive in Orleans), a priest and a cook were killed. It was one of the worst accidents in the peacetime history of the RCAF.</p>

    <p>Unlike today, when Canada’s fighter jets normally operate out of only two airbases (Cold Lake,  Alberta and Bagotville, Quebec) during the Cold War interceptor squadrons were stationed throughout the country. One of them, the 445 All-Weather Fighter Squadron, was based in Uplands to protect the National Capital. At approximately 9:00 pm on that fateful night radar operators from Air Defence Command in St. Huebert, Quebec detected an unknown plane approaching the region from the north and, fearing a Soviet bomber, dispatched two CF-100s to investigate.  The intruder turned out to be an RCAF transport plane returning to Montreal from the Arctic and the fighters broke off their chase.  One of them returned directly to Uplands while the other, piloted by Flight Officers William Schmidt and Kenneth Thomas, circled the skies east of the city to practice maneuvers and burn off excess fuel.  For reasons which have never been determined the pilots lost control of the aircraft and it plummeted to the ground. The prevailing theory is that a malfunction in the oxygen supply system resulted in hypoxia and the pilots losing consciousness although this will never be proven for certain.</p>

    <p>Unrelated to these events, at the beginning of November 1956 445 Squadron was moved from Ottawa to Marville, France where it joined the Number 1 Air Division Europe on NATO assignment until being disbanded at the end of 1962.  Four years later the Saint-Louis Residence opened on the site of the former convent and it is still operating to this day.  On a path near the river behind the hospice a memorial cross now stands amidst 15 blocks of debris from the Villa Saint-Louis to mark the lives of each of the victims of that sad night.</p>
