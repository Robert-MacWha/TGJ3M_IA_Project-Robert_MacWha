    <p>Heading west across Ontario there are distance markers placed religiously along the side of the highway telling you how far you still have to go before leaving the province. There’s a lot them. A lot. Like 2000 of them. At some point on the north shore of Lake Superior it appears as if the road crews gave up on installing them. Perhaps someone in Toronto couldn’t bring themselves to imagine the need to order any more signs or maybe the government just couldn’t afford them that year.  Possibly someone in Marathon or Schreiber with nothing better to do started a collection and the markers for kilometers 1245 to 1412 inclusive now adorn their basement walls. It doesn’t really matter, because out here the distances are so great, the ribbon of road so insignificant, that the only thing that does have meaning are the small pockets of humanity strung out, sometimes unreasonably far apart, along the highway.</p>

    <p>Between Thunder Bay and the Manitoba border there are perhaps a half dozen little towns like this offering refuge from the surrounding forests. These stopping places, like so many any other small towns in Canada, have the appearance that they are dying or, at best, holding on by a thread. Maybe there’s a pulp mill, or a paving company, but otherwise its hard to understand how these settlements survive. There is a vague sense that everything peaked during the Second World War when the whole country worked together to defeat hatred and evil. Maybe the boom times came later, in the 1960s, when working class families from the steel mills of Hamilton and the car factories of Oshawa drove their station wagons north for fishing trips to the deep woods. Flannel pants and pipe smoke. No matter; today these towns definitely look as if the best has come and gone.</p>

    <p>And yet there is a remarkable resilience to these places. Defying the intense winter cold, the awesome distances and even global trade patterns these communities hold on. And there is something still hidden in these forgotten little oases, these outposts, for which we should all be grateful. Perhaps because of their small size, or their distance from the larger distribution centres, they have been by-passed by globalism. True, there will be a familiar gas station and a few well known restaurants lining the side of the highway with the promise of bonus reward points but much more common are the small, family run dinners. Roadside eateries where you can drink your coffee from a white ceramic mug, chipped perhaps along the rim, and order homemade pie by the slice while contemplating paintings by some local artist named “Nanci” desperately for sale on the wall. Absent too are the multinational hotel chains which dominate every off-ramp of the US Interstate system and travelers instead are offered rooms at the Trappers Inn or the Hitching Post Motel. Places where you drive right up to your door grab a shower and then sit on the cement walkway under a bug-stained light drinking cold beer and watching the trucks pass by on the highway. These towns are time-capsules of what the road was like a generation or two ago before corporate greed and consumer complacency reduced the world to three choices of beige.</p>

    <p>We should be grateful for these small struggling businesses, most of which need a coat of paint and a few more customers. We should be grateful too for the people who chose to live here deep in the woods and far from the concerns of the plastic world which we now inhabit. These are people who have a potato patch in their back yard, maybe some turnips, and a moose in the freezer. They know how to fix their own snowmobiles and don’t need to call anyone when the autumn wind blows the shingles from the roof. They know their neighbours and come together at the Legion Hall to celebrate and mourn the comings and goings from their community. Together these places hint at what we once were. They remind us that long before we lived in cities and worried about the price of parking we were once a northern people who walked into the forest unafraid and that because of that we are somehow different. Better even.</p>

    <p>If you ever find yourself on the Trans-Canada Highway stop in one of these towns for a night or two. Smell the wood smoke, eat the pickerel, play a hand of cribbage. It will be as much a voyage of time travel as geographical movement and you will find yourself humbled for the effort. When I see places like this it makes me believe that there is still hope for us all and that just maybe we won’t trade everything away for a better Wi-Fi signal and the same type of bland pizza from St. John’s to Victoria.</p>

    <p>The American folk singer Greg Brown once lamented “I watched my country turn into a coast to coast strip mall.” Thank God they missed a few places.</p>
